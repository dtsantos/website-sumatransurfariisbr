          part of our conversation. Danny thanks heaps for all your help getting 
          this trip together. We all had a ripper trip, the surf was good the 
          crew were excellent and last of all the boat it was a floating hotel 
          and had everything you could have ask for and made the trip really easy. 
          The Indonesian crew were fantastic and really looked after us, Bevo 
          and Webbie have really good knowledge of the area and was a pleasure 
          to surf with and have a couple of cold Bintangs with at the end of the 
          day.Watching Scuzz surf HT's at 6-8ft clean, was some of the best tube 
          riding I have ever seen in the flesh, to hear him say that he had a 
          head ache from too many barrels was something I will remember. Well 
          I can say Isurfed it and had a crack but didn't get any barrels quite 
          like that but thats something to strive for next trip, Danny could you 
          please pass on the thanks to all of the guys from Sumatran Surfaris. 
          Thanks mate.</font></strong></p>

          I've just completed my first day back at work after a 48hr trip home 
          to Byron. I'm a little shattered but have that satisfied glow after 
          2 weeks of fantastic surf, people and places.</font></strong></p>
        <p align="left"><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
          I know I speak for all the guys on our trip when I say that the Budyadahri 
          and her crew were amazing. Those guys run the best possible operation 
          you could imagine and continually impressed us with their help and happy 
          attitude. The food, in particular, was a highlight. You guys obviously 
          place great importance on keeping everyone stoked up and Yento is a 
          legend in the kitchen. I did get in trouble this morning when I sat 
          up in bed and yelled to my wife "Breakfast?".</font></strong></p>
        <p align="left"><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
          Bevo and Webby did an amazing job getting us to the best waves and capturing 
          the images of a lifetime. Bevo's laid back attitude and local knowledge 
          got us to all the best waves before anyone else. Along with Webby's 
          photo's, his "whistle" to signal us to take off on some monstrous 
          outside set so he could get the shot became the calling card of the 
          trip.</font></strong></p>
        <p align="left"><strong><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br>
          All the guys had a great time and experienced the waves of their lives 
          (especially that day at HT's when we got to see the Scuzz tube show 
          in person) so we left the Ments with exhausted shoulders and a grin 
          from ear to ear. Well done to everyone involved and look forward to 
          seeing you over there again soon. Please pass on our thanks to the Budyadahri

          was a total sensation when I consider the quality of surf we got at 
          HT&#8217;s, Macca&#8217;s and Burgers (Telescopes was small but perfect

          Scuzz, <br>
          <br>
          The dust has settled, I'm back at work, shuffling paper and hoping for 
          good waves down the coast this weekend. Its nearly a month now since 
          we returned from the SC trip, and it seems so long ago already. Definitely 
          suffering from PMD - post Ments depression! <br>
          <br>
          I just wanted to personally thank you for a fantastic trip, particularly 
          given it was so soon after the quake. Understandably your main concern 
          in early October was helping your extended SS family, which you managed 
          to do so well via your own fundraising and actions (not forgetting Mama 
          Padang probably shouldered much of that load), but also getting the 
          charters moving so quickly and virtually seamlessly! Nonetheless, I 
          was very grateful that we were still able to have our trip, score some 
          excellent (not all time, but mostly empty high quality) waves, and thus 
          support your business and therefore all your team and their families. 
          I had a lot of people quiz me before and after as to why I would continue 
          the trip given the quake, however we took our lead from you that the 
          best way we could help out was to come. <br>
          <br>
          Not only did we come, but I've been spruiking the trip to anyone who'll 
          listen, and as you may or may not know, it looks like I'm stowing away 
          with the old Avalon boys next October as well. I figure going with "Dad's 
          Army" I'm always gonna feel young, not to mention what a great, laidback 
          bunch of guys they were to surf and hang out with. <br>
          <br>
          Special thanks to everyone in your organisation, from the drivers who 
          picked us up, to the girls who fed us ripper Mie Goreng and cold beers 
          that first steamy arvo, to Christine who organised our money and internet 
          to home, then of course all the SC crew including Aki, AK, Kiko and 
          yourself. We always felt safe, comfortable, well fed, and well guided 
          to the best empty waves available. I don't know about the other blokes 
          but I reckon I was surfing better than I have in 10 years (still not 
          that good!) and having a ball. Surfed Maccas on my own (slight onshore, 
          2-3 foot, but just me!), got a million good waves at Roxies, and dusted 
          off my rusty backhand at beautiful Telescopes. Even the shit swell that 
          was around when you came aboard still resulted in fun waves at Bintangs 
          and Burgers, and made us appreciate all the more the quality we'd had 
          for the first 9 days. <br>
          <br>
          So its only 10 and a half months till we catch up again on SC or Mik 
          2 and I'm already counting the days, working out and hoping to be fitter 
          and better prepared than last month. <br>
          <br>
          Cheers till then mate, best wishes with all the off season trips and 
          maintenance, and perhaps next year we'll head north to new adventures 
          and more filthy waves. Keep up the good work in Padang and hopefully 
          we can squeeze a few more trips in before that bigarse quake arrives 
          and increases the value of your little island hideaway! <br>
          <br>

          believe I've been back home for over one week already, time is just 
          flying. Now that things have settled down I wanted to take the opportunity 
          to thank you for your hospitality and friendship during our trip. I 
          was totally relaxed on the boat, and this was due to the fact of the 
          crew on board. They were always eager to assist or help out whenever 
          they could, and always had smiles on their faces. It was definitely 
          my best holiday ever. I've been to the Maldives twice on boat trips 
          and the Southern Cross is by far the best deal. I hope you and your 
          charming partner Christina are well, and I look forward to more future 
          trips aboard SC, maybe with my 2 sons. Also, those Heinekens were absolutely 
          sensational, really went down well. </font></strong></p>

        <p align="left"><strong><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Danny,</font></strong></p>
        <p align="left"><strong><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
          was my 7th trip to Indo so I feel the subject line requires a bit of 
          justification.</font></strong></p> <div align="left"><strong><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There 
          was a lot of drama this year with my buddies bailing and me stressing 
          about having enough guys to make the trip a go, but once we got there 
          it all rinsed away. Even with a solid swell forecast Scuzz and Yu were 
          unanimous - go South, go South, Tora! Tora! Tora!. I had been leaning 
          that way myself. After years of running from the crowds it was time 
          to just go where the waves are. The hackneyed, played-out, cliched, 
          overcrowded Mentawais. The Mentawais, where the B-waves would be the 
          A-team anywhere else. When we got to the boat Marsh and I were stoked 
          to see AK paying us a surprise visit. The Padang crew was totally on 
          it and Mikumba was underway within a very short time of our flight arriving. 
          Straight off the crossing we dropped anchor at Telescopes at first light 
          30 min before sunrise, an hour before anyone else came by. The first 
          day there was plenty swell but with some funny wind and lump. Icelands 
          handed out free beatings, no charge. The next morning things were much 
          smoother and Yu put us on offshore, overhead Telescopes with no other 
          boats for multiple sessions. It was special - I've very rarely had waves 
          that good with so few people out. That was day two.</font></strong></div>
        <p align="left"><strong><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That 
          night the engine fired up in the dark and at first light we dropped 
          anchor at beautiful head high HT's. We were the only boat there and 
          first ones in the water. Guys trickled out from the beach but with three 
          peaks working the crowd again wasn't a factor. It was<br>
          an ideal day to get a feel for HT's and figure out how to stay off the 
          Table. In the midday the wind was shifting around so the goofy half 
          of the crew hopped in the tinny and took off for Lance's while Mikumba 
          stayed at HT's. Lance's had perfect, glassy, overhead lefts with nobody 
          out. No boats, nobody there at all. Bevo and I shared the cobra peak 
          and it was niiiiice! I'll never forget how quiet and peaceful that session 
          was. Lance's is a beautiful spot.</font></strong></p>
        <p align="left"><strong><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
          next day we headed south. Bat Caves had nobody out and it was a lot 
          bigger than it looked. Two boards, one hat, and one booty died at sea. 
          We pulled the anchor and headed for Maccas. As we came aroundthe point 
          into the bay the bommie outside KFC's had 10 foot backs,easy. My heart 
          started racing - it would be my first go at Macca's and Bevo kept whooping 
          and saying it was going to be ON. I had been telling the guys that Macca's 
          would be "fun, rippable, and crowded" and I was now about 
          to eat my words. We pull up and there is one guy in the water, no boats, 
          and Maccas is throwing sub-sea level death holes. It was a little onshore 
          and backlit making the pit look especially dark. It's making my guts 
          churn just to type this. I dug out my Gath and Yu, Bevo and I had a 
          go. When we paddled past the one guy he was sitting way off on the shoulder, 
          wide-eyed, and visibly bleeding from his neck. The swell was straight 
          south so there was no wall and no shoulder hopping, either take off 
          in the pit or you miss it. We all caught a warm up or two and Luciano 
          came out. One big bomb came through throwing a lip about 2/3 up the 
          face and froze us all - even Bevo blinked. It's so rare to get such 
          incredible and gnarly waves all to yourself - honestly it was as much 
          Indo as anyone wanted. Hollow, perfect, the edge of anyone's ability, 
          nobody around, the best case scenario you hope you'll be ready for. 
          The carnage continued - another board died.</font></strong></p>
        <p align="left"><strong><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Next 
          morning we shared Macca's with a handful of West Oz chargers. It was 
          offshore, sunny, cleaner, and still bombing. I never waited long for 
          my turn, having seen it the night before I knew where to sit and pumped 
          and stalled through some of the best barrels of my life. Soja and AK 
          were shooting photos from the tinny and had it in so tight that I paddled 
          out around the tinny a couple times. Everyone had a go at Macca's that 
          morning but it was time to push on to something less intense. The sets 
          were also making the anchorage a bit unsafe. Cap kept yelling "Om 
          De!" as the tops of the big walls pushing into the bay slid under 
          Mikumba. The sets were about eye-level with the top deck railing. Yu 
          took a heavy one and snapped his board, but came up smiling. Abunai!</font></strong></p>
        <p align="left"><strong><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">With 
          the regularfoots looking for a more user-friendly option Yubypassed 
          a couple heavy lineups and found us a really fun right, head high plus 
          and nobody around. The magic of the Ments - when it's big and gnarly 
          it always seems like there is some mellow option around. There was still 
          some carnage though - Bolts snapped his boss-looking yellow 3" 
          thick Tuflite 2 board. The next day we knew better than to leave good 
          empty rights. A couple boats came, surfed, and left, but Yu kept us 
          there for a magical, super-clean sunset session where the performance 
          wave transformed into racy, perfect tubes with just a couple of us in 
          the water.</font></strong></p>
        <p align="left"><strong><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Thunders 
          was really pretty the next day. Not huge, sets just a bit overhead, 
          offshore, nobody around. I kept telling the guys the swell had dropped, 
          the wind had some S in it and they needed to get out there before all 
          the other boats arrived. But nobody ever showed - we had it to ourselves 
          until we pulled the anchor late in the day. Thunders is a really good 
          wave. After Bevo explained his scar we were all wary of that inside 
          suckout!</font></strong></p>
        <p align="left"><strong><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On 
          the way back north a couple days later we hit HT's again, first thing 
          in the morning. A couple overhead sets rolled in and we thought, yeah 
          it's ON! Once we got out there the waves switched off for a while - 
          it was just shoulder to head high, weak, weird. After so much good surf 
          in previous days Yu showed patience and steady nerves, and around 4 
          o'clock from dead low tide the wind went offshore and double up bombs 
          just start rolling through. I guess what the tide took away in the midday 
          it gave back for the sunset session. Gnarly, well overhead double-ups 
          rolling in from the outside and unloading, some more makeable than others. 
          I got a few good ones taking off under the double-up, got stuffed on 
          a few, and was having a decent go - almost everyone out there was as 
          skittish as I was. I was wondering why more of our guys weren't coming 
          out when I found out Jason picked a bad one, got a bad beating and got 
          a nasty fin slice on his leg. Hearing about his stitches (capably performed 
          by Yu) and almost copping a big cleanup set on the head I took my winnings 
          off the table. I wanted to get video of perfect front-lit HT's more 
          than I wanted another wave. Once again we had for the taking as much 
          Indo as anyone wanted, and we were just super-stoked for the opportunity. 
          Those were some of the most intense rights I've ever witnessed from 
          the water, just incredible lip oncussion, awe-inspiring. A couple of 
          the tuberides we saw were straight out of September Sessions, and the 
          crowds were at about 1999 levels too! Carnage: Three boards with huge 
          holes, one leg had a mouth, and many egos recalibrated.</font></strong></p>
        <p align="left"><strong><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Next 
          morning HT's was onshore, around the bend for some double-overhead plus 
          Lances. There were two other boats there but only 5-7 guys in the water 
          all morning. I just missed a big one and remember thinking I hadn't 
          looked that far down in a loooooong time. Once again for most of us 
          it was as much Indo as anyone wanted, right there for the taking. We 
          motored on to Scarecrows and there were 2 guys in the water with overhead 
          sets. Nobody ever goes to the Mentawais thinking "I hope we score 
          Scarecrows" but I got a really long barrel on the inside that stands 
          out as much in my mind as any of my waves. It may not have been as gnarly 
          looking but it was super fun, and there were only a few guys out all 
          afternoon.</font></strong></p>
        <p align="left"><strong><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Playgrounds 
          was forgettable. Yu tried to talk us out of it but most of us had never 
          been and he was totally flexible. I knew he was probably right but I 
          just had to see for myself. It was tough conditions up there, hard SW 
          winds, chop, full of boats and camp guys. I didn't realize it's really 
          just the one island Nyang-Nyang that works consistently. The other spots 
          up there need pretty specific conditions and maybe aren't that dependable. 
          In any case we were so sated from all the waves earlier in the trip 
          that we actually started the crossing about 4 hours early on the last 
          day. Bintangs, BS, sitting in the breeze, cracking "Garuda" 
          peanuts and throwing the shells off the rail just never gets old.</font></strong></p>
        <p align="left"><strong><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As 
          for Mikumba, we were loving the huge new shady front deck area. We missed 
          the front sailing mast for about 30 seconds, then proceeded to spend 
          almost all our waking hours under or on top of that shade deck We were 
          also _very_ appreciative that our boards weren't hanging in the gnarly 
          Indo sun like we saw on so many other boats. Guys who hadn't done a 
          boat trip before were amazed that other boats had boards stored in partial 
          or direct sun.</font></strong></p>

          recently did a trip in late October of 2008 with our good buddy Thomas

          My hubby is back safe and sound and had another wonderful trip with 
          you guys.<br>
          <br>
          Sounds like a pretty rough ride back into Padang, but just adds to the 
          stories.<br>
          <br>
          One of these days I'll have to make the trip w/ him, maybe stay at the 
          resort for a week or two or do some volunteer work while he surfs.<br>
          <br>
          I feel so good knowing he is in good hands when he is so far away. It 
          means alot and as I stated last time, nothing beats a surfed out husband 
          after he spends 2+ weeks on a boat w/ a bunch of men surfing as much 
          as he wants. I think it maybe the key to this wonderful journey of life 
          I am on with this man.<br>

          Guys,<br>
          <br>
          Trying to get back into normality after the trip away and got a big 
          case of the after holiday blues, particularly when its cold, wet and 
          raining here.<br>
          <br>
          Firstly a very big thank you to all the people that were involved with 
          our trip from everyone at the hotel to the guys on the boat, Tolong, 
          Sojar, Iman, sedikit Eddie and Capt'n. Amadu sayang Sojar! I can't really 
          say enough about how good the guys on the boat were, they were just 
          totally onto it the whole time and had everything covered. I've now 
          been ruined for any other holiday away.<br>
          <br>
          AK, a huge thanks for everything you did for all of us and the advice 
          you gave me. It won't be forgotten. Although the waves didn't get epic, 
          with trying conditions you managed to always find us something good 
          to surf. Can't really ask for much more than that. Steve passed on the 
          tapes and CD for Jason Cooper in Victoria and I have posted to him. 
          I spoke to him on the phone and he was absolutely frothing to see the 
          footage and photos.<br>
          <br>
          AK, good luck with the development of "Tom &amp; Gerry's", 
          I can't wish you nothing but success in the future. Hopefully you'll 
          stay in touch and let me know how it goes. The trip was epic for me 
          as it was something I always dreamed of doing, but never really thought 
          it would happen. Please pass on my gratitude to all those who were involved.<br>
          <br>
          Kind regards and all the very best.<br>

          the work while we did nothing. Well, once again, thanks for an epic 
          trip. We scored killer waves pretty much every day. Between Yu and Bevo, 
          we were on the best surf with the least crowds, the majority of the 
          time. I sent some photos to share the stoke! Thanks again and can't

          <br>
          Thanks for another awesome trip. You guys have made so many improvements 
          on Mikumba since I last sailed on her in 2006. The big fast console 
          tinny is awesome. You'd have to be a complete klutz to slip, trip, or 
          bash your head. Not one board got dinged in the new board racks, the 
          fridge kept the beers ice-cold, and as soon as we would catch a fish 
          Tu Lan would go straight to work on the sashimi for dinner. The waves 
          were great. We never got an A+ macking scary indo day but given conditions 
          and logistics I don't think there was one to be had. I surfed all but 
          one day and got barreled almost every day. Huge credit to AK and the 
          crew for putting us on the best waves available with no boats around 
          right at the crack of dawn. <br>
          <br>
          The guys on the trip all got along great - a fun, mellow group. I was 
          worried that 10 guys would be a porta-crowd but we were hardly ever 
          in the water all at once, generally it seemed like we were split across 
          two nearby spots - that two-tender advantage again! Toward the end we 
          talked about going together again next year. It's harder to find friends 
          in California who have the commitment to go to indo than it is to meet 
          new people in Indo that I get along with great!<br>
          <br>
          Here are some of the photos from our trip: <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/mikumba2008" target="_blank">http://picasaweb.google.com/mikumba2008</a><br>
          <br>
          My best wave of the trip was at Slayer's on the second day - a double-barrel 
          spitter that starts the 5th row down in the surfing gallery. Your namesake 
          is a killer wave in a magical setting. I'm psyched that Jason was willing 
          to sit on the beach and shoot that morning. That was a very special 
          session, just me and a couple other guys.<br>
          <br>
          What's the Mikumba schedule like for next year? Looking at the video 
          from that November trip to the Ments is making me consider a shoulder-season 
          trip down there instead of going up north again.<br>

          very honest, absolutely amazing. I cannot thank you enough Danny for 
          your help in making my trek possible. Your care in making sure I could 
          make it all happen was very generous and made for me, a trip of my lifetime. 
          So thanks deep and sincere thanks...</strong></font></p>

          you Scuzz, I'm not sure what to say...I know I asked lots of dumb questions 
          but I truly came away changed, and I am grateful for your generosity, 
          your skilled guidance, your patience, and your honesty....I would be 
          grateful if you would pass on my sincere thanks to Abu for his kindness 
          in letting me get behind the helm. The boys are now sending texts and 
          emails addressed to captain Jim!!!! I will be back to the Ments, I know 
          that. Not sure when or how yet but I look forward very much to seeing 
          you again. Bon Voyages! You are a gentleman, a scholar, and so much 
          more....as I have said, you fight the good fight. I wish you every success.

          here. We were on Mikumba from 25th April to 9th May 08. North Trip. 
          I just wanted to drop you a line to say how stoked we all were with 
          the trip, and to thank you for your help getting everything sorted. 
          You certainly were not kidding when you said how good it was going to 
          be!!</strong></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>Great 
          waves, great crew, great boat! I'm not sure what AK &amp; the crew thought 
          of 10 surfers from Northern England, probably the wierdest bunch they've 
          had for a while. I think it took AK two or three days just to understand 
          what we were saying (Laughs). We had good waves every single day! AK 
          was totally on it, and used his considerable knowledge to make sure 
          we were always in the right place at the right time. More often than 
          not, we were the only boat at the break and had it all to ourselves! 
          The average session count for the 13 day trip must have been in the 
          30's , I'm sure the grommets had more than 40 sessions!!!! AK and the 
          rest of the crew were extremely well organised, and nothing was too 
          much trouble, making being on the boat a very relaxed &amp; enjoyable 
          experience. The boat (Mikumba) was superb. Comfortable and with lots 
          of room, you could always find a bit of space for yourself if needed. 
          It was also easily the most 'kick-ass' boat in the ocean.</strong></font></p>

          it's just over a month we got back from Heaven and just can't wait for

          the Southern Cross and the following morning wake up to glassy seas, 
          breakfast and waves, no wonder they call it the playgrounds. To surf 
          waves that are uncrowded, no hassles and warm water was exceptional 
          to an overweight middle aged bloke that hadn't done much surfing in 
          the past 18 months. To go away with guys who's ages varied from 22 to 
          59 and then be met by yourself and a crew that provided not only a service 
          that rivals any five star hotel,(no wonder you call it the Southern

        <p align="left"><strong><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Signing 
          on a mere two weeks before Mikumba was scheduled to depart, Danny Siudara 
          (a.k.a. Slayer) walked me through the process and made me believe that 
          this was going to happen. I have seen the images in surf mags of the 
          Indo barrels for decades after leaving my "life as a surfer" 
          in 1986 to make a move from Del Mar to Northern California. Surfing 
          for me was now a once or twice a year event in So Cal during the holidays. 
          Questioning Danny if this was right for a "48 year old knee-boarder 
          in semi-retirement" he assured me that I could still pull-in with 
          the best of them.</font></strong></p>
        <p align="left"><strong><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Fast 
          forward to the end of 2 days of air travel and we arrive at the airport 
          in Padang at sunset. Adam and his crew were there to meet us and the 
          adventure was on. With our boards and gear loaded up, we were off to 
          the Hotel Batang Arau. Through the darkness we endured a flat tire and 
          finally made it to the Hotel where we were greeted by Scuzz and Christina, 
          the gracious hosts. Christina made sure we were comfortable and ready 
          for the journey that was ahead of us. After a quick bite and finishing 
          up with the details, we left the Hotel for the drive to Mikumba. Once 
          aboard Mikumba, we met the crew and settled our belongings into our 
          cabin as we slipped anchor and motored into the black void of night 
          - destination unknown. As a last minute member of the Cali posse, I 
          was happy to be on this adventure with my brother-in-law Dan and his 
          surfing bro's Chris Dartland, Chris Murphy and Dax Billings. We got 
          acquainted during the flights to Padang after first meeting at LAX, 
          solidified by a 3 plus hour adventure at the wine bar in Singapore at 
          1:30 in the morning during a layover. Also aboard were two amazing surf 
          dogs- Pete, currently teaching English in Japan and originally from 
          Nova Scotia (surf nut) and an amazing athlete, and Joe, an immediately 
          returning guest who was on the previous Mikumba trip and wanted more 
          (having already endured some 100 plus reef reminders, cuts and gashes). 
          I knew this was going to be good.</font></strong></p>
        <p align="left"><strong><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
          Bintangs went down easily that night as we settled in for the adventure 
          of a lifetime. We woke up the next morning to amazing waves, just as 
          AK promised. The names of the many breaks we surfed mattered little 
          to me. The reality that I was in Indo, and not only witnessing "perfect" 
          waves but having the opportunity to surf them, was overwhelming. AK 
          wanted to test our abilities, and when he called me into my second wave 
          of the day, the joy of it all made me feel so fortunate to have the 
          opportunity to be in the Mentawais. Having caught more waves that first 
          session than I did all of the previous year, and they were killer waves, 
          brought back more than just a stoke. Be it a Left or a Right, it didn't 
          matter to me because they were always scary fun. Over the next several 
          days, I would briefly just sit on my trusty old Fish on the shoulder 
          and be in awe of the beauty of place and time. Just being with a group 
          of "surfers', that surf lifestyle exemplified returned me to my 
          younger days. One day in the tinny, I told AK that just being here, 
          watching a perfect barrel- a combination of the right tide, wind and 
          swell direction, this deep water focused energy meeting a reef was all 
          I needed at that moment. I needed an adventure and I was certainly getting 
          more than I had expected. Day after day- amazing waves, tolerable or 
          minimal crowds in paradise, amazing snorkeling, nearly ideal weather, 
          consistent fishing and great friendships. What more could you ask for?</font></strong></p>
        <p align="left"><strong><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Since 
          I didn't surf ever session, it took the formidable crew a while to understand 
          who I was and why I was there if I wasn't "surf crazy" like 
          the rest of the boys. For me, surfing the unbelievable waves was a bonus. 
          I was there to be with my Bro' Dan, and to be on a boat, Mikumba. I 
          am at my best aboard a racing sailboat, but this "pirate ship" 
          was going to be just fine! The craftsmanship was of a time honored tradition, 
          built in the Sulawesian style. The crew could see the serenity that 
          Mikumba gave me: Warm Tropical waters with unbelievable clarity, sunrises 
          and sunsets that just kept on giving, rain or star filled night skies 
          and an appreciation of the little things that make the big picture more 
          valuable. Some of my best memories were the times I had the crew to 
          myself, while all of the rest of the boys were in the water.</font></strong></p>
        <p align="left"><strong><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These 
          men of the Sea were amazing- Eddie kept the lights on, the beer cold 
          and the engine and A/C purring; Sargent kept us in shape by dropping 
          us close to the break from the "tinny", but far enough that 
          we still had a paddle to the line-up or back to the tinny which gave 
          him such pleasure. He cleaned up behind us and made us feel at home; 
          Tulong is such an amazing cook- always with a smile, he fed us three 
          or four beautiful meals a day of the freshest food, spiced up just right. 
          On the last night during the transit back to Padang, he served up the 
          Wahoo I had caught earlier in the day three ways- sashimi, deep-fried 
          and satay style, an absolutely killer send off. Why the hell are we 
          going home again??? Ovi was a key crew member- always one step ahead 
          of us, skills beyond belief and a great person to be around. I will 
          always think of him driving the tinny, backing up in the corner so I 
          could takes some amazing photos of the boys; Captain always carried 
          a smile too- he would get us from point A to point B in style, with 
          Mikumba swaying and rocking to the beat of an iPod jacked into the stereo 
          system. On the final transit, he asked me if I wanted to drive, and 
          I jumped at the opportunity to point Mikumba in the right direction. 
          For us, the right direction included the spectacle of several pods of 
          whales, swimming so calmly that AK, Dan and Joe dove in for a swim with 
          these magnificent creatures. To say that the passage was surreal would 
          be an understatement, for sure.</font></strong></p>
        <p align="left"><strong><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Then 
          there was AK, Adam Kobayashi- his experience far beyond his years on 
          this planet. He asked for our trust and he rewarded us daily with waves 
          that memories are created from. He was always "straight-up" 
          with us, even though' sometimes this was confusing. I spent many hours 
          with AK and the crew in the wheelhouse, after deck, salon or in the 
          tinny. I can't imagine the trip without AK as our guide, and I hope 
          he will be the guide when we return. I'm sure of it- he gave us an amazing 
          trip of a lifetime, until we do it again. AK, you better start planning 
          now...</font></strong></p>

          to the real world was a non-cultural shock that I never expected. The

          it fucking sucks. I want to thank everyone who had a part in this EPIC 
          voyage, a trip of discovery, peace, serenity and life. The scenery, 
          people and the children of Indonesia will always have a place in my 
          heart, alongside the crew of Mikumba. Scuzz and Christina have fostered 
          an incredible organization, and with Danny on this side of the equator 
          making it smooth as glass, I can't wait to go again. Maybe next time

          can't thank you enough for the incredible two weeks we had. I feel priviledged 
          to have been able to enjoy such a beautiful place without the masses 
          you typically associate with perhaps the most popular surf destination 
          in the world. It was exactly the experience I think we were all looking 
          for. What makes it even better is that no matter where we went or who 
          we talked to- whether it was fellow skippers, Mentawai people, Tom Carroll 
          for God's sake- there is a universal respect and appreciation for you. 
          Not to get all mushy on ya but in my book, you have to give respect 
          to get respect and it is obvious that you have earned every bit of it 
          by doing things the right way. Realizing that you have a business to 
          run and people who depend on you for their livelihood, I am sure it 
          has not been easy for you- where others may have cut corners or taken 
          advantage to earn a few extra bucks you have probably had some tough 
          decisions to make.</font></strong></font></p>

          not knowing what you are going to get is half the fun. Sorry if I am

          the fact that I wasn't sure if I would even make my first part of the

          worth of flying, I think I can our trip was probably one of the best 
          trips I have ever been on. Our group was awesome and everyone had a 
          great time together. Ask AK or Dr. Evil about the "Band" and 
          a whole slew of stories will surely follow. We consumed more beer than 
          I knew possible but were still on it early and all day. Some great tubes 
          at **** even though that place took more flesh in a single day from 
          me than any of my previous two trips to Indo and other locales such 
          as Samoa combined. We caught some ***** waves way up north pretty darn 
          good and had it solo for two days only to laugh at seven boats that 
          pulled up as we were pulling anchor and headin back south. Damn good 
          barrels and walls up there. Hell session at Asu broke my board after 
          the second wave but a quick replacement put me back out there and we 
          had it damn good all day. Overall one hell of a trip with the best crew 
          and captain I have ever had. Even though I started full time work a 
          few days after getting back to the states and probably won't be able 
          to take a trip like that again for years to come, I think the amazing 
          memories might be able to last a little while. I just wanted to thank 
          you guys for making it so enjoyable. I attached a photo as requested 
          by AK for future use by you guys. Hope to be able to do this all over 
          again at some point in the future even if I am a bit greyer. </strong></font></p>

        <p align="left"><strong><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As 
          a first time participant in an organised surf trip this was a new experience 
          for me and I think that the whole Mikumba crew and Padang support team 
          deserve a huge pat on the back. I could not have asked for a more conscientious 
          and easy-going guide than "AK" and when he said on the first 
          night that we'd only have to do 2 things (unpack on day 1 and then pack 
          on day 14) he was right. We surfed a mix of lefts and rights and I'm 
          really grateful that AK, Mono and the crew were able to get us to a 
          location each dawn that had swell and offshore winds. <br>

          Every session in the surf was memorable for one reason or another and 
          it was a real treat surfing with a new bunch of guys that all got on 
          really well. Calling each other into waves quickly became the standard 
          and will be one of things that stays with me for a long time, I could 
          go a whole week surfing at home and there's not much chat in the water.<br>
          <br>
          The food was fantastic and I think also that getting access to a couple 
          of the kampongs / villages that we anchored near was a treat.</font></strong></p>

          Well Mikumba Boys it&#8217;s been a month now since returning home and 
          I feel I owe you all a few comments about our trip in June. I choose 
          the word &#8220;owe&#8221; because what you did for all our crew goes 
          much further than us just being a customer. You treated us like family. 
          This was my first trip north and the experience brought me (us) back 
          to our roots. Although we cannot do it as frequently as we like, we 
          all live for this! And live we did. We also hope Aki is doing well.<br>
          <br>
          On just our second day some of the boys delivered an exiting session 
          at one of AK&#8217;s favorite spots. It was nice to see even Scuzz was 
          entertained by the evening photos. I&#8217;m just glad that AK had faith 
          in us after making sure we could surf. I swear I am going to send him 
          a copy of Poisons, &#8220;Every Rose has it&#8217;s Thorns.&#8221; The 
          second day was pretty fricken magical and already made up for the long 
          travel it takes to get to my favorite place in the world. The highlight 
          of this day for me was sharing a spot with Soldier (just him and I) 
          for a couple hours on his home turf. Can&#8217;t wait till next time 
          Soldier&#8230;..<br>
          <br>
          <a href="./images/kellertest/niceright.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="home_data/nicerightsm.jpg" align="left" border="0" height="200" hspace="6" vspace="0" width="300"></a> 
          We moved further north, bought some goods, and Treve even sent a local 
          back to his casa without his paddle. But it&#8217;s ok - he came back 
          with more. ;)<br>
          <br>
          Next three days were going offfffffff&#8230;. Nothing like pulling up 
          at the premier spot just as the swell hits. After surfing our brains 
          out for three days and as the swell died we headed to some exposure 
          and of course a storm hits. AK thought we may want to head back. Nothing 
          like a little adventure with an experienced crew!<br>
          <br>
          Finished off with a good left for the goofys. I&#8217;ll never forget 
          that morning when AK said, &#8220;Come on Keller, go be the Ginny.&#8221; 
          Day turned out pretty darn good. Catching a Mahi on the way back and 
          looking at the Southern Cross in the sky that night was like a fine 
          Cognac after the perfect meal. <br>
          <br>

          I can&#8217;t say thank you enough to the whole crew but I&#8217;ll 
          say it again, thank you. That includes Mano and Tomo, as well as the 
          crew at the hotel. AK, well done, Shaka. And we cannot forget the man 
          who puts it all together, Danny. Always following through and keeps 
          the group in check. Killer food, always a clean boat, and we managed 
          not to run out of beer. Do we still hold the record? Please give a peace 
          sign to my Buddy Yu as I consider him a good friend. If any of you come 
          to Cali you&#8217;ve got a place to stay.<br>

          a 2 week trip aboard the BD and this boat has the best layout out there 
          with tons of space to hang out and relax! I would not want to be in 
          any other boat!!! The sleeping beds are comfortable, the TV/DVD area 
          is great, the bathrooms are strategically placed on the side of the 
          boat and the toilets and showers work well. The upper deck is golden 
          and it was where we mostly hang out during the day and night with the 
          stereo always cranking some great tunes! The food was great and the 
          ice cream too!!! :-) Let me say that you have the best friken crew out 
          there!!! The guys go way beyond their duties and are always there to 
          whatever you need! From the cook to the captain and not to mention the 
          engineer who can fix boards better anybody I have ever seen! Yu and 
          Bevo often in the speed boat taking some great shots of the guests!!!! 
          :-D All of them amazing people which I became good friends with. I had 
          a fantastic time out there and did not want to come home! We scored 
          amazing waves with hardly anybody around! Telescopes, Lance's, HT's, 
          Macca's, Thunders, Rags and even Green Bush! WOW !!!!! Incredible place, 
          awesome boat, unbelievable waves, great people and the best time of

          trip ruled. No place on earth quite like that. It was my first trip 
          and definitely not the last. I'd have to say too, the crew was constantly 
          on it at every decision. All was always handled, and things were smooth 
          as could be, despite mother nature. Seas a little rough? No worries. 
          Cappies on it. Need to switch a board? Jai's on it passing it down to 
          Soldier in the zodiac, and simultaneously tuning the motor. Need lunch? 
          Tulong is in there making the spiciest thing you've ever eaten, and 
          laughing his head off the rest of the day when you eat it. Cut your 
          hand off? There's Mano to sew it back on. Then there's AK callin it 
          day in and day out. Once he showed me the skatepark, they could've left 
          me there and picked me up on the way back. But push on and be rewarded. 
          And that we did. Cappy manhandled 10 ft seas for hours on end. Ovi and 
          Jul rocked tunes while the sun went down, lighting up the sky. The barrell 
          opened up and Tomo was there to get the shot. Catching fish. Eating 
          sushi! Rooftop chill sessions with Mano owning the drum and talking 
          of Brasil. Things were surreal there. Like a lifetime packed into 2 
          weeks. The water's cold here. Back to autopilot. Work. Save. Go to Indo. 
          I look forward to my return and thank you for escape of a lifetime.</font></strong></p>

          Thank you, Aki, Captain, Boody, Eddie, Joe and Erie for an awesome trip. 
          Super fun uncrowded waves, we felt so looked after by your crew it was 
          a real break from what I what I normally do managing a recycling and 
          waste management business. And the fish and the food was mindblowing 
          - not what I expected to be munching on a boat in the middle of the 
          Mentawais.<br>
          <br>
          And thanks for giving us the "Monkey" experience. He was an 
          hilarious character who brought an eternally youthful attitude to the 
          water.<br>
          <br>

          African charger. The rest harked from New Zealand, North Carolina and 
          Japan. It was quite a challenge catering for mixed abilities and fitness, 
          but the Budyadahri seemed to be able to optimize the best waves in the 
          conditions. The introductory sessions at Playgrounds and Bang Bang were 
          the perfect warm up for what lay ahead at Thunders. We surfed everyday, 
          whether it be the playful Bang Bang or the heaving Thunders. Most of 
          the time we were well ahead of the pack - testimony to Sheldo's experience 
          and the ocean knowledge of Captain Baron, who would drop anchor each 
          morning at another uncrowded gem. Our voyage took us to most of the 
          big spots E-bay, Lance&#8217;s Left, Macaronis, Japan Island, Thunders, 
          Rag's Left and on the final day a heaving HTs.</strong></font></p>

          chill out and sink the odd tinny on the sundeck after a big day in the 
          water. I think that blew me away the most was the quality of waves, 
          after 2 weeks of cranking swell and constantly being ahead of the pack 
          surfing uncrowded barrells, it was a testament to your experience in 
          the area. I have some other crew that are keen to head down next August 
          and it would be great if yourself and Budyadari were free for another 
          sojourn.</font></strong></p>

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>I 
          was amazed at the distances and the variety of the breaks in the Mentawais, 
          but we still managed to surf for an average of 6 hours a day for 15 
          days with multiple sessions at at least 12 different spots. From rights 
          that seemed like Kirra, to epic epic places like Maccaronis, we did 
          it all. We also managed to do it while avoiding most other boats and 
          hooking in some chunky fish along the way. This is all thanks to our 
          expert guide, Yu, who was just awesome. He not only knew the Mentawais 
          area better than most people know their local surfing area, he was consistently 
          playing the game smart, checking other charters itinerary, listening 
          on the radio, to avoid others and pick the best waves. He was also totally 
          stoked on sharing the waves with us and seeing us get some dream green 
          rooms wherever he could direct the Budyadahri. He also taught us a bit 
          about how to ride some thick mutants at Bank Vaults. It is a credit 
          to you guys to train the guides to that level, and after the trip, it 
          has become obvious to me that a really good guide is more far more valuable 
          than a slightly faster boat in order to score good uncrowded surf.</strong></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>The 
          rest of the crew were superb too, all friendly and happy, and worked 
          really hard to make sure that we got around the islands safely on full 
          stomachs and with a cold Bintang in one hand wherever possible. One 
          of the fellas was an expert ding repairer, which was pretty lucky as 
          there were some serious holes of fibre glass to replace on some of the 
          boys boards even by the end of the first day. They made it a real holiday, 
          and sorted out pretty much everything from racking the boards up to 
          hanging up wet clothes hanging around etc.. They also knew about how 
          to pull in the big fish. They were pretty excited about some lures we 
          bought onboard, which were so nasty looking that I am surprised we got 
          them through customs. Unfortunately, they lured big fish that our lines 
          just couldn&#8217;t cope with; we lost them both to a 2 metre sailfish 
          that snapped the lines like dental floss; what a sight though seeing 
          a fish like that go absolutely mental jumping around until it got loose!!</strong></font></p>

          Sorry I haven't got back to you sooner. Obviously, I've been back from 
          Indo for some time, but one thing leads to another and somehow I've 
          procrastinated on dropping you a line.<br>
          <br>
          We had a blast on the tour. We got very solid surf in the Telos, not 
          tubing, but long workable lefthanders with fun sections. A surprise 
          secret right in the Telos provided one of the funnest waves I've ever 
          seen when it turned on for a couple of hours one evening. Sort of bad 
          weather and smaller waves in the middle of the trip, but still surfable 
          every day and we got some good fishing and diving. The end of the trip 
          was the bomb...we were in the Banyaks waiting and we got the last three 
          days of the trip overhead with perfect winds all day. Just insane. I 
          can't tell you how glad I am that I was able to stay for the end of 
          the trip! If I didn't straighten out my last minute work crisis, I would 
          have missed what turned out to be pretty much the best waves of my life.<br>
          <br>
          The crew was great. They really worked their asses off to keep the boat 
          clean and organized and keep us all stoked. Aki Nori kept us on the 
          right spots at the right time, and kept us laughing every night. I can't 
          tell you how much Saka's cooking made for a great trip. That guy really 
          does a lot with the simple ingredients and cooking facilities he had 
          to work with. Every night we were amazed by the variety and quality 
          of the grinds he was throwing down. The other guys were quiet, friendly, 
          and soulful and always working hard to keep things sweet for us.<br>
          <br>
          You've really got some good people working with you and for you. Again, 
          kudos to the crew for staying on top of things and minimizing the impact 
          of the issues.<br>
          <br>
          Thank you both for your generous offer to work with my potentially f'd 
          up schedule...it really all worked out well. Please pass my thanks on 
          to Christina as well, I don't seem to have her email handy. <br>

          On behalf of our group, a HUGE MAHALO to you and your crew for everything. 
          For many of us, this was our first surf trip we've taken, and it was 
          absolutely incredible! The crew (Edi, Bujon, Baron, Sul, and Hen) were 
          awesome! Everything we could've wanted, they had, and they busted their 
          butts to insure that everything down to the smallest detail was taken 
          care of. We could not have asked for a better crew. They kept everything 
          clean and immaculate. They were there to take us in the speedboat wherever 
          and whenever we wanted, and I cannot put into words how great these 
          5 guys were. Just to give you an example, one of our guys brought a 
          pair of binoculars and they got all fogged up with salt water, you could 
          not see a thing when you looked through them. The next morning, we woke 
          up and looked at the surf, I picked them up and they were fixed; totally 
          clear of all fog! When we asked who fixed them, none of the crew wanted 
          to take credit for it initially. We finally figured out who it was. 
          This crewmember took it upon himself to take the binoculars apart, wipe 
          down the lenses from the inside and reassemble them. He fixed it without 
          us asking him to and then wouldn't take credit for an amazing job. The 
          crew was so humble and so graciously accomodating, it was amazing and 
          refreshing to meet such wonderful and kind people! <br>
          <br>
          Yu (surf guide) was absolutely, ridiculously on top of everything. He 
          found us places to surf no matter what the swells, winds, and conditions 
          were like. He went above and beyond the call of duty by preparing a 
          professional quality DVD for all of us. He always made sure everyone 
          got waves, he was absolutely fantastic! A lifelong friend to all of 
          us, I'm sure. <br>
          <br>
          Everything went perfectly from being picked up from the airport, to 
          getting places, everything went off without a hitch! Traveling that 
          far from Hawaii was a little scary, but the scheduling, trip planning 
          that you all did made everything go so much smoother than we could've 
          ever hoped for! Thank you so much Danny. This trip was absolutely fantastic 
          and we will undoubtedly tell everyone we know over here in Hawaii that 
          if they are planning to go on a surf trip, that the Mentawai Islands 
          is where it's at, and that you and your company, Sumatran Surfariis 
          is unquestionably the BEST surf charter company around! <br>
          <br>
          Thank you from all of us here over in Hawaii,<br>

          you showed my son a real happiness over a long course of our most adored

          This is a pretty unique enterprise by Chris, Chris, and Crew and it

          A total of 18 hours was spent in the air but we finally made it. Stepping 
          off the plane a few degrees below the equator is like walking into a 
          wall of water. The humidity immediately soaks your clothes. The Indonesian 
          people are very friendly and we were met by kids yelling &#8220;hey 
          mistah&#8221; with big smiles on their faces. We spent the afternoon 
          at a small hotel along a river drinking 50 cent beers and eating $2 
          pizzas. At dusk we walked down the boardwalk to our boat, the Southern 
          Cross, and scrambled aboard to pick the best bunks. This dorm style

        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>Great 
          trip. I don't know if I can put down the right words but knowing this 
          was MIKUMBA'S first trip out of Sibolga, I have to say it went very 
          well. Every step of the way through out the travel we were met immediately 
          by someone who ushered us quickly and efficiently through the red tape 
          of foreign travel. Once we got to where the boat was moored we met AK. 
          The boat wasn't quite ready for us to board so we were made comfortable 
          at the hotel in Sibolga for a short time till we boarded. The boat was 
          clean. big and spacious. The crew was absolutely on it! They kept the 
          boat clean and organized all the time and the food was excellent. </strong></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>We 
          traveled north and worked our way up. Not much swell but still sampled 
          some fun waves every day for the first few days. This was alright &#8216;cause 
          we were all still adjusting to our new surroundings and environment. 
          A few days in we had some minor crew drama, which was quickly and smoothly 
          worked out. With this behind us things started to open up and flow nicely 
          we shared Asu with two other boats for a couple of days while a decent 
          swell pulse went through. We easily shared sessions with the other boat 
          crews and had a couple of magical hours of surf each day. My 40th birthday 
          and the dice game blah blah blah. Ouch! Kept going north and surfing 
          every day. Eventually bumped into a couple other boats but were able 
          to stay out of each other&#8217;s way. I think out of the two or three 
          other boats we ran into we scored the best and most consistent surf. 
          Of course not knowing the area we always wondered what it was doing 
          somewhere else but the boys kept us on it. We looked at other spots 
          when we couldn't stand the pressure anymore and always felt like we 
          hadn't missed the call for that day. We scored little swell pulses regularly 
          and had a great time. STOKED!</strong></font></p>

          I must say that I was amazed the way you organized the trips between 
          Medan and Sibolga! I did it by myself a couple of times, and it was 
          hard to believe that it can be so smooth! At every stop, we had someone 
          to help us, and for the return trip, even though you have to cope with

          The boat is so huge that is easy to find a spot for yourself if you

          the crew, to make everything perfect... But after this, everything went 
          fine, good organization on the boat. For a first trip, the crew did 
          really well. And the cook Saka is a real "Chef"! The boat 
          is ready for a great season.</strong></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>Concerning 
          the surf, despite the lack of swell, we did really good!!! 10 days out 
          of 13, at least one guy on the boat got a barrel! We scored ****, a 
          perfect Asu during 2 days, and all the spots on **********! I'm not 
          sure the Californian surfers (very cool guys) really realized how good 
          Adam did with this swell condition.</strong></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>For 
          me, the last day was kind of special! The Californian guys did not want 
          to surf ******** (most of them were goofy, it was pretty inconsistent, 
          they preferred to surf ******), Adam dropped me on Southern Cross to 
          spend the day. I got such a warm welcome from Aki and the Indo Crew 
          (Capt. Maytek, Jo, Bhuddy, Harry). I was really touched! And I surfed 
          ******, got 6-7 bombs peeling perfectly for 400 meters, first time for 
          me since the earthquake. I'm so stoked this wave is still that gem!!!</strong></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong>Leaving 
          from Sibolga was a real plus, since we could surf the ****** on the 
          last day. The only drawback was that I didn't spend anytime in Padang, 
          to give a big hug to the surfer of the year and a big kiss (with your

          Speaking on behalf of our group, you and your crew are beyond words!!!! 
          Slayer was so accommodating, simplifying everything from our boat schedule 
          (Thanks a million for the Budadahri, what a treat!!) to our flights, 
          health insurance, what to bring lists, etc. He set it up where global 
          travel felt easier than domestic!! Truly making the hard parts of the 
          trip cruise!! Yu was over the top!!! He should get an award for ALWAYS 
          being on it no matter what the condition!!!! We surfed nine spots in 
          eleven days ranging from fun to ridiculously perfect!!!! He had the 
          boat rolling before sunrise always ensuring we had good surf everyday!!! 
          Yu is a true waterman. He went out a mile, dove 30+ feet, speared a 
          fish, just to ensure we had fish that night. He put together a DVD of 
          our trip that was of complete professional quality. By far the best 
          video/DVD of our entire group&#8217;s personal library!!! </strong></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><strong> 
          The crew took excellent care of us treating us like kings. They kept 
          the boat clean and immaculate. Edi&#8217;s food was delicious (fish, 
          chicken, vegetables, all fresh and very tasty). Zul and Hen never let 
          us paddle. They watched us like hawks. The slightest movement toward 
          the surf and they had your board and the dingy ready to take you (amazing 
          how they knew each of our boards). With a wave of your board they were 
          there to pick you up from the line up with a cold one!! Out of this 
          world!!!! Bujong never stopped working illustrating he could build and 
          fix anything (including Josh&#8217; leg). A true hero!! And Boron gave 
          us the utmost confidence in driving the boat safely while catering to 
          our every surf whim (leaving on a moments notice). Your entire organization 
          is the best of the best!! And imagine this you exist in the most perfect 
          wave enriched environment in the world!!! We have all unanimously concluded 
          that Sumatran Surfariis has the best to offer in surf travel. The best 
          waves, the best crew, the best attitude, the best understanding of both 
          the Mentawai people and waves, and the best organization of travel!!

          taking great photos, and generally getting along well and having a great 
          time with all of us. We had good quality waves nearly every day - head 
          high Burgurs - overhead Macca's - several good days at Lances Left and 
          HT's ranging from 1 metre to well overhead. We can't beleive our luck

          A.K. and the whole crew made me feel most welcome and the boys from 
          OZ were incredible. I feel so lucky that I got to spend an amazing 14 
          days with some of the friendliest, funniest people I have ever met. 
          I totally lucked out all around. I think that they would all agree that 
          I proved I could be one of the boys. Well, except for maybe the dice 
          game. I lost royally but I was still a good sport and accepted the standard 
          loser punishment... you get the idea. Good fun all around, not counting 
          the hangover the next day. All in all an incredible adventure.</font></strong></p>

          trip was insane - scored 11 days of epic waves, got spastic drunk on 
          the 11th for my b'day tried to drown the crew and then it was downhill 
          from there...... hardly anyone around. **** was best wave by far, although 
          **** was pretty bullshit, and **** was freaking glass perfection for 
          one amazing 2 hr session, also the 'super super super super' (ha ha) 
          secret right we surfed was pretty sweet. asu kicked our arse - not enough 
          lefts for the goofys would prob be the only complaint, besides having 
          to come home.<br>
          <br>

          on behalf of our crew I must say you guys are truly the absolute BEST!!!!!!!! 
          This was a trip of a lifetime for all of us!!! Everything came together 
          perfectly due to the obvious time you have spent both searching out 
          waves (figuring out conditions etc) and dialing in your crew. Slayer 
          did an excellent job of corresponding and keeping us informed every 
          step of the way. Every commitment he made came true. He made us all 
          feel as though we chose the right charter and put us at ease from the 
          beginning. Also his communication with our families regarding the unfortunate 
          earthquake illustrated how on top of things he is. He got information 
          to our families ASAP in a very sincere manner (making our return trip 
          that much easier on the home front). Yu was absolutely amazing!!! He 
          was responsible for ensuring we got the best waves each day had to offer 
          while being one step ahead of the crowd. This was accomplished every 
          day without the slightest doubt!!! Yu is most definitely an expert at 
          knowing and understanding each particular spot including all contributing 
          conditions. We scored waves everyday because of his excellent decisions!!! 
          On top of all of that he put together the most amazing DVD that captured 
          all of our footage including his. This was absolutely over the top and 
          we were all blown away!!!! Cochi did a great job getting us to each 
          spot safely with the best vantage points possible. We all felt safe 
          with Cochi at the wheel!!! Tulang was absolutely amazing. The food was 
          excellent and furthermore Tulang catered to our every need (smoothies, 
          tea, etc). Every meal was delicious!!! Bujong never stopped working 
          and was always there to help with anything that could arise (setting 
          up fishing poles, driving the skiff, fixing things). He has an incredible 
          work ethic! Soja was awesome!!! He made our beds daily, even washed 
          our clothes a couple of times. He drove us in the skiff and was always 
          there to handle our boards (which we never had to lift a finger). And 
          last but definitely not least Hasan. Always smiling and always on it!! 
          He never let us paddle. He ensured we ALWAYS had a ride to the line 
          up!!! He also helped make our beds and help us with whatever we needed.</font></strong></p>

          waters and who have been fishing these islands for many years our nerves 
          were at rest. Sure the AFRIKA is no indies trader, but it can travel 
          further and faster and it`s Indo design makes you feel like you belong 
          in those waters. Looks like the 7 of us will be back again this summer

          have been on three trips with Sumatran Surfariis, and I am going on 
          my fourth this summer. The more I know about Boat Trips from my experiences 
          and those of other people I've met along the way, the more confident 
          I am with Scuzz and his boys! Wether it is the Mentawais or "Up 
          North" these guys know what is up. On my second trip, on the flattest 
          days, we got waves. On the windy stormy day, we got offshore conditions. 
          When the crowds were getting a bit thick, we got surf by ourselves. 
          I'd compare notes about those days with other guys we'd see in the line 
          ups. And some of their captains were totally amiss. Many of the other 
          crews did NOT surf on the flat day or the windy day, at all. We were 
          stoked, Scuzz knew were to go and we surfed every single day. This is 
          just the tip of the ice burg. If you are serious about your surfing 
          and getting the best waves possible, go with these guys. Also, since 
          Scuzz and Chritina own their own hotel, you are set as far as layovers 
          or down times before the boat leaves. I've checked out the other hotels 
          the "other" guys have to stay at and Batang Arau Hotel is 
          much better. For one, it is beautiful and peaceful. You don't have to 
          deal with seeing other surfer dudes and it is a great deal. A great 
          place to chill and drink a beer and unwind from the flights and travel. 
          Also Sumatran Surfariis are partnered with a Padang local, Om. If you 
          hang out enough you can see that the locals and his crew really like 
          and respect these guys, and that is important. As far as the two trips; 
          Up North vs the Mentwais, I could write for ever. They are both insane. 
          I can't wait until my next trip, I'm counting down the days!</span></font>
